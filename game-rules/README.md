## 📝 Design Principles

1. **Instant gratification** — Every encounter drops *something*. Even trash mobs give tokens, loot, or story beats.
2. **Simple math** — d20 + bonus. A 7-year-old should never need to calculate more than single-digit addition.
3. **Tactile play** — Lego tiles as seals, coins as gold, minifigs as heroes. Physical > digital.
4. **No permadeath** — Heroes get knocked out, never killed. Stakes come from story, not fear.
5. **Reward creativity** — Bonus XP for clever ideas, funny moments, helping teammates.
6. **Spells are toys** — Kids love unlocking new abilities. Give them lots, make them feel powerful.
7. **Heroes feel heroic from session 1** — Starter abilities, Hero Surge, minion enemies, and buffed HP ensure kids never feel helpless.

## 🔄 v1.1 Changelog — Early Level Rebalance

**Problem:** Level 1 heroes were too fragile. Getting KO'd by a Giant Rat in session 1 was demoralizing.

**Changes:**
- **Starting stat points:** +1 → **+2** (can split across stats)
- **HP formula:** TGH×3 → **TGH×3 + 5** (Level 1 heroes have 14 HP instead of 9)
- **Starter abilities:** Every profession gets a 1/battle ability at Level 1 (auto-unlocked first skill tree node)
- **Hero Surge:** 1 free reroll per battle — safety net against bad luck
- **Minion rules:** 1 HP enemies that die in one hit — heroes feel powerful
- **Heroic Start:** First session only — advantage on attacks until first combat win
- **Nerfed Level 1 monsters:** Giant Rat (2 HP/1 dmg), Goblin Scout (5 HP/2 dmg), Skeleton (6 HP/3 dmg)
- **New Level 3 monster tier** added for smoother progression
- **Skill point column** added to leveling table
- **Skill tree integration** across all documents
