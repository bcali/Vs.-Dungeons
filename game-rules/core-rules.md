## 8. Skill Trees

Every class has a **talent tree** — a branching web of abilities and bonuses unlocked with skill points. Think of it like the talent system in World of Warcraft or the skill menu in Diablo.

### Skill Points

- Earn **1 skill point per level** (20 levels = 20 points total)
- Spend points in your class's talent tree branches
- Each point unlocks a new skill OR ranks up an existing one
- Unspent points carry over — no need to spend immediately

### Branches

Each class tree splits into 2–3 branches representing different playstyles:

| Class | Branch 1 | Branch 2 | Branch 3 |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Warrior** | Protection (tank/shield) | Arms (two-handed DPS) | — |
| **Rogue/Ranger** | Shadow (stealth assassin) | Precision (ranged sniper) | Survival (traps + pets) |

You can spread points across branches or go deep into one. There is no wrong build.

### Tier Gating

Higher-tier skills are locked until you've spent enough points **in that specific branch**.

| Tier | Points Required in Branch | Power Level |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Tier 1** | 0 points | Fundamentals |
| **Tier 2** | 3 points in branch | Intermediate |
| **Tier 3** | 6 points in branch | Advanced |
| **Tier 4** | 10 points in branch | Expert |
| **Tier 5** | 15 points in branch | Capstone |

With 20 total career points, realistic builds look like:
- **Deep specialist** (15+ in one branch): Reaches Tier 5 capstone. Incredibly powerful in one area.
- **Balanced** (10/10 split): Tier 4 in two branches. Very versatile, no capstones.
- **Focused + dip** (13/7 split): Tier 4 main + Tier 3 secondary.
- **Triple spread** (Rogue only — 7/7/6): Tier 3 in all three. Jack of all trades.

### Skill Types

- ⚔️ **Active** — Abilities you use in combat. Must be equipped to your **Action Bar** (5 slots).
- 🛡️ **Passive** — Always-on bonuses. No slot needed. Once learned, always working.

Some skills have **2–3 ranks**. Each rank costs 1 point and makes the skill stronger.

### Core Skills

Each class also has **Core Skills** — universal abilities any build can take. Core skill points do NOT count toward branch tier gating.

### The Action Bar (5 Slots)

Heroes have **5 action bar slots** for active abilities.

- Only **active skills** (⚔️) and **spellbook spells** go in slots
- **Passive skills** are always on — no slot needed
- Swap abilities freely outside of combat
- Normal melee/ranged attacks are always available (no slot needed)

### Skill Trees + Spellbook

The skill tree **extends** the spellbook system — it doesn't replace it.

| System | What It Provides | Cost to Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Skill Tree** | Talent tree skills + passives | **Free** (with cooldowns on strong abilities) |
| **Spellbook** | Profession spells (Battle Cries, Techniques, etc.) | **Spell Slots** |
| **Normal Attack** | Basic melee/ranged | **Free** (always available) |

This means tree abilities are your "always available" toolkit, while spellbook spells are limited-use power moves.

### Respec

**Free respec, anytime.** Kids can reset their entire tree and redistribute all points.

- No gold cost, no penalty
- Can respec between encounters, sessions, or during a rest
- Encourages experimentation — try tank, then switch to berserker next session
