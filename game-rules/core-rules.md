# ⚔️ LEGO QUEST — Core Rules

*Complete game system reference. Print-friendly.*

---

## 1. Stats

Every hero has 6 stats. All start at **3**. At Level 1, add **+1** to any stat.

| Stat | Abbr | What It Does |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Constitution** | CON | Hit Points (CON × 3), resist poison/traps, endurance |
| **Strength** | STR | Melee damage, lifting, breaking, carrying, melee defense |
| **Agility** | AGI | Turn order, dodging, ranged accuracy, movement, ranged defense |
| **Mana** | MNA | Spell/ability power, magic checks, max mana pool (MNA × 15) |
| **Intelligence** | INT | Spotting secrets, puzzles, crafting, knowledge |
| **Luck** | LCK | Crit range, loot quality, lucky saves |

**Stat Bonus** = Stat − 3 (Stat 3 = +0, Stat 5 = +2, Stat 10 = +7)
**Stat Cap** = 15

---

## 2. Dice

One **d20** for everything. Roll d20 + stat bonus ≥ target number = success.

| Difficulty | Target | Kid Name |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Easy | 8 | "Piece of cake!" |
| Medium | 12 | "Tricky..." |
| Hard | 16 | "Yikes!" |
| Epic | 20 | "LEGENDARY!" |

**Nat 20** = Auto-success + something awesome (double damage, bonus loot)
**Nat 1** = Auto-fail + something funny (never deadly)

---

## 3. Luck

Luck is the wildcard stat that affects crits, loot, and gives a once-per-session safety net.

| Mechanic | How Luck Applies |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Critical Range** | Nat 20 always crits. LCK 5+ also crits on 19. LCK 8+ crits on 18. LCK 12+ crits on 17. |
| **Loot Bonus** | Add LCK bonus to loot roll (d20 + LCK bonus on the loot table) |
| **Lucky Save** | Once per session, reroll any single d20 (free, no resource cost) |
| **Lucky Find** | GM can call for a LCK check to find hidden items, passages, or bonus treasure |

---

## 4. Resource Systems

Each profession uses one of three resources to fuel their abilities. Resources replace the old spell slot system.

### Resource Types

| Resource | Used By | Max Pool | Regeneration |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Energy** | Rogue | 100 | +20 per turn (passive) |
| **Rage** | Knight / Warrior | 100 | Earned through combat (see below). Starts at 0 each fight. |
| **Mana** | Wizard, Healer, Ranger, Inventor | MNA × 15 | +20 per turn (passive) |

### How Rage Builds

Warriors don't passively regenerate — they get angrier as the fight goes on.

| Rage Source | Amount Gained |
|------------|---------------|
| Take a hit | +15 Rage |
| Land a basic melee attack | +10 Rage |
| Get critically hit | +25 Rage |
| Ally gets knocked out | +20 Rage |
| Certain rage-generating abilities | +10–20 (noted per ability) |

### Ability Costs by Tier

| Tier | Unlock Level | Resource Cost | Power Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 (Basic) | 2 | 30 | Simple, fun effects |
| Tier 2 (Veteran) | 5 | 30–40 | Dramatic, visual |
| Tier 3 (Champion) | 8 | 40–50 | Tactical, clever |
| Tier 4 (Hero) | 10 | 50–60 | Powerful combos |
| Tier 5 (Legend) | 12 | 60–70 | Battle-changing |
| Tier 6 (Master) | 15 | 70–80 | Devastating |
| Ultimate | 20 | 100 | Once-per-battle showstopper |

### Rest & Recovery

| Rest Type | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Short Rest | Restore 30 resource (Energy/Mana) or set Rage to 0 |
| Long Rest | Restore all resource to full (Energy/Mana) or set Rage to 0 |

---

## 5. Combat

**Initiative:** d20 + Agility bonus. Highest first.
**Each Turn:** 1 Move (6 studs) + 1 Action + Resource Regen (Energy/Mana +20, or Rage from sources)

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Melee Attack | d20 + STR bonus vs. enemy STR + 8. Hit = STR damage |
| Ranged Attack | d20 + AGI bonus vs. enemy AGI + 8. Hit = weapon damage |
| Cast Ability | d20 + MNA bonus vs. target. Uses Energy/Rage/Mana |
| Use Item | Potion, bomb, gadget. No roll |
| Defend | Skip attack. Enemies need +4 to hit you |
| Help Friend | Ally gets +3 on next roll |
