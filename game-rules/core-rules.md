# ⚔️ LEGO QUEST — Core Rules

*Complete game system reference. Print-friendly. v1.1 — Early Level Rebalance*

---

## 1. Stats

Every hero has 4 stats. All start at **3**. At Level 1, add **+2** to any stats (can split, e.g. +1 STR / +1 SPD).

| Stat | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **STRENGTH** | Melee damage, lifting, breaking, carrying |
| **SPEED** | Turn order, dodging, ranged accuracy, movement |
| **TOUGHNESS** | Hit Points (TGH × 3 + 5), resist poison/traps |
| **SMARTS** | Spells, spotting secrets, puzzles, crafting |

**Stat Bonus** = Stat − 3 (Stat 3 = +0, Stat 5 = +2, Stat 10 = +7)
**Stat Cap** = 15

> **Example:** A Level 1 Knight puts both +2 into STR. STR becomes 5 (+2 bonus), everything else stays at 3 (+0). Or they split: +1 STR (4), +1 TGH (4) — both at +1 bonus.

---

## 2. Dice

One **d20** for everything. Roll d20 + stat bonus ≥ target number = success.

| Difficulty | Target | Kid Name |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Easy | 8 | "Piece of cake!" |
| Medium | 12 | "Tricky..." |
| Hard | 16 | "Yikes!" |
| Epic | 20 | "LEGENDARY!" |

**Nat 20** = Auto-success + something awesome (double damage, bonus loot)
**Nat 1** = Auto-fail + something funny (never deadly)

---

## 3. Combat

**Initiative:** d20 + Speed bonus. Highest first.
**Each Turn:** 1 Move (6 studs) + 1 Action

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Melee Attack | d20 + STR bonus vs. enemy TGH + 8. Hit = STR damage |
| Ranged Attack | d20 + SPD bonus vs. enemy SPD + 8. Hit = weapon damage |
| Cast Spell | d20 + SMT bonus vs. target. Uses spell slot |
| Use Skill Tree Ability | See ability description. Free (cooldown-based) |
| Use Item | Potion, bomb, gadget. No roll |
| Defend | Skip attack. Enemies need +4 to hit you |
| Help Friend | Ally gets +3 on next roll |

**Knocked Out** at 0 HP (not dead). Ally revives with action (1 HP) or potion.

### Hero Surge ⚡

**Once per battle**, any hero may **reroll any single die roll** (their own attack, a defense check, even a loot roll). This is a safety net against terrible luck streaks. Use it or lose it — doesn't carry between battles.

> *Lego tip: Give each player a special "Surge token" (a unique 1×1 tile). They flip it face-down when used, flip it back at the start of the next battle.*

### Minions 💀

Some monsters are **Minions** — weak enemies with **1 HP**. Any hit kills a minion, no matter how much damage it would deal. Minions still deal their listed damage if they hit, but they exist to make heroes feel powerful.

Rules for Minions:
- Mark any monster as a minion by writing **(Minion)** after its name
- Any successful hit kills a minion — even 1 damage
- Minions still deal their normal listed damage on a hit
- The GM should include 2–3 minions in the first combat of every session
- Great for: Goblin Scouts, Giant Rats, Skeletons, any "pack" encounter

> *Example: "You face 3 Goblin Scout Minions and 1 Goblin Captain." The scouts die in one hit each, letting heroes feel awesome. The captain is a real fight.*

### Heroic Start 🌟

**First session only:** All heroes roll attacks with **advantage** (roll 2d20, keep the higher) until they win their first combat encounter. After that first victory, normal rules apply.

This guarantees the first fight of the campaign feels heroic. By the time advantage drops off, the kids have confidence and momentum.

> **Skill Points** are spent in the profession skill tree (see Section 8 and `skill-trees.md`). At Level 1, every hero gets their starter ability auto-unlocked for free — no skill point needed.

### Hit Points

**HP = Toughness × 3 + 5**

The +5 base HP gives every hero a buffer against early bad luck. A Level 1 hero with TGH 3 has **14 HP** instead of the old 9. A hero who puts a point into TGH (making it 4) has **17 HP**.

| TGH | HP (old) | HP (new) |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 3 | 9 | **14** |
| 4 | 12 | **17** |
| 5 | 15 | **20** |

### XP Awards

| Activity | XP |
|----------|-----|
| Defeat monster (at/above level) | 3–5 |
| Defeat monster (below level) | 1 |
| Defeat Boss | 10–15 |
| Complete quest | 10–25 |
| Solve puzzle | 5 |
| Creative/heroic moment | 2–5 |
| Help another player | 2 |
| Explore new area | 3 |
| Session bonus | 5 |

### Micro-Rewards (Every Encounter)

*The GM should give at least one of these after every encounter, no exceptions:*

| Reward | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| **Token Drop** | 1 Common seal, 1–3 gold coins |
| **Flavor Loot** | Shiny rock, goblin's lucky charm, old map piece, weird mushroom |
| **Story Crumb** | A note, a symbol, an NPC mentions something |
| **Title/Nickname** | "The village kids now call you Ratslayer!" |
| **Physical Token** | Hand the player a Lego piece for their minifig |
| **Cool Description** | Describe their victory in cinematic detail |

## 5. Professions

Choose at Level 1. Each has a **recommended stat focus**, unique abilities, and a **skill tree** with branches.

| Profession | Role | Best Stats | Spell Flavor | Starter Ability | Skill Tree Branches |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Knight** | Tank / Frontline | STR + TGH | Battle Cries | Brave Strike | Protection, Arms |
| **Ranger** | Ranged / Scout | SPD + SMT | Techniques | Aimed Shot | Precision, Survival |
| **Wizard** | Damage Caster | SMT | Spells | Zap | *TBD — future expansion* |

| **Rogue** | Stealth / Burst | SPD + SMT | Tricks | Cheap Shot | Shadow, Precision, Survival |
| **Inventor** | Gadgets / Summons | SMT + SPD | Blueprints | Boom Bolt | *TBD — future expansion* |

### Starter Abilities (Level 1 — Auto-Unlocked)

Every hero gets their profession's starter ability for free at character creation. These are the first node in each profession's skill tree and do NOT cost a skill point.

| Profession | Ability | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Knight** | **Brave Strike** | 1/battle: Melee attack at +3 to hit, deal +2 damage |
| **Ranger** | **Aimed Shot** | 1/battle: Ranged attack at +3 to hit, deal +2 damage |
| **Wizard** | **Zap** | 1/battle: Deal SMT damage to one enemy within 6 studs (no roll needed) |
| **Healer** | **Soothe** | 1/battle: Heal self or ally for 5 HP (no roll needed) |
| **Rogue** | **Cheap Shot** | 1/battle: Melee attack at +3 to hit, target gets −2 on its next roll |
| **Inventor** | **Boom Bolt** | 1/battle: Deal 4 damage to one enemy within 6 studs (no roll needed) |

> *These are "1/battle" abilities — use once, resets next battle. Simple to track, always gives kids a special button to press.*

*See [spellbook.md](spellbook.md) for full spell lists by profession and tier.*
*See [skill-trees.md](skill-trees.md) for complete skill tree details.*

## 6. Monsters

Monsters use the same 4 stats. Scale by level.

### Minion Variants

Any monster can be made into a **Minion** (1 HP, dies in one hit). Use minions generously at early levels. Recommended: start every session's first fight with 2–3 minions + 1 regular enemy.

### Level 1

| Monster | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | HP | Dmg | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Giant Rat | 1 | 4 | 1 | 1 | **2** | **1** | Pest. Dies fast. Use as minion or pack of 3. |
| Goblin Scout | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | **5** | 2 | Basic melee enemy. Good as minion too. |
| Skeleton | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | **6** | 3 | Hits harder but slow. Satisfying to smash. |
| Slime | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | **9** | 1 | Tanky but harmless. Puzzle enemy — find weakness. |
| Bandit | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 9 | 3 | "Hard" Level 1 fight. Use as mini-boss for early encounters. |

**Boss — Goblin King:** STR 4, SPD 3, TGH 4, SMT 2, **HP 16**, **Dmg 4**. Summons 2 Goblin Scout Minions below 8 HP.

> **Level 1 design note:** Heroes now have 14+ HP and a starter ability. These nerfed monsters ensure early fights are winnable but still require dice rolling and decision-making. Giant Rats should be one-shot kills. Goblin Scouts go down in 1–2 hits. The Goblin King boss is a real fight but survivable.

### Level 3

| Monster | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | HP | Dmg | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Goblin Warrior | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 9 | 3 | Upgraded goblin with shield |
| Dire Wolf | 4 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 9 | 4 | Fast, pack tactics (+2 if ally adjacent) |
| Shadow Imp | 2 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 3 | Teleports 4 studs after attacking |
| Mushroom Beast | 5 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 12 | 5 | Slow but hits hard. Poison spore on death (2 dmg, 2-stud area) |
| Tomb Guardian | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 12 | 4 | Undead. Immune to poison. |

**Boss — Spider Queen:** STR 5, SPD 4, TGH 5, SMT 3, HP 20, Dmg 5. Web attack roots 1 target (SPD check 12). Summons 2 Spider Minions (1 HP, 2 dmg) each turn.

### Level 5

| Monster | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | HP | Dmg |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Orc Warrior | 6 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 15 | 6 |
| Dark Mage | 3 | 4 | 4 | 7 | 12 | 8 |
| Stone Golem | 7 | 2 | 8 | 1 | 24 | 7 |
| Wolf Pack (3) | 5 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 9ea | 5 |
| Shadow Thief | 4 | 7 | 3 | 5 | 9 | 4+psn |

**Boss — Dragon Hatchling:** STR 8, SPD 5, TGH 7, SMT 4, HP 30, Dmg 10. Fire breath 4-stud cone (8 dmg), flies.

### Level 10

| Monster | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | HP | Dmg |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Troll | 10 | 4 | 9 | 3 | 27 | 10+rgn |
| Lich | 5 | 6 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 15 |
| Giant Spider | 8 | 8 | 7 | 4 | 21 | 8+web |
| Minotaur | 11 | 5 | 10 | 3 | 30 | 12 |
| Elemental | 9 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 24 | 10 |

**Boss — Ancient Dragon:** STR 13, SPD 8, TGH 12, SMT 10, HP 50, Dmg 15. Fly, fire breath (15 cone), frightful presence.

### Monster Building Formula

For custom monsters: **Level ÷ 2 + 2 = average stat**. HP = TGH × 3. Boss HP = TGH × 4 or 5.

For **Levels 1–3**: reduce average stat by 1 (Level ÷ 2 + 1). This keeps early monsters beatable by starting heroes.

## 8. Skill Trees

Every profession has a **skill tree** — a branching web of abilities and bonuses unlocked with skill points. Think Diablo or World of Warcraft talents.

### How Skill Points Work

- Heroes earn **1 skill point per level** starting at Level 2 (2 at Level 20)
- At Level 1, every hero gets their **Starter Ability** auto-unlocked for free
- Points are spent on skills within your profession's tree
- Each branch has **tiers** — spend enough points in a branch to unlock the next tier
- Skills can have **ranks** (invest multiple points for stronger effects)

### Skill Types

| Type | Icon | How It Works |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Active** | ⚔️ | Goes in your Action Bar. Use as an action in combat. Free (cooldown-based). |
| **Passive** | 🛡️ | Always on. No action needed. Permanent bonuses. |

### The Action Bar (5 Slots)

Heroes have **5 action bar slots** for active abilities.

- Only **active skills** (⚔️) and **spellbook spells** go in slots
- **Passive skills** are always on — no slot needed
- Swap abilities freely outside of combat
- Normal melee/ranged attacks are always available (no slot needed)

### Skill Trees + Spellbook

The skill tree **extends** the spellbook system — it doesn't replace it.

| System | What It Provides | Cost to Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Skill Tree** | Talent tree skills + passives | **Free** (with cooldowns on strong abilities) |
| **Spellbook** | Profession spells (Battle Cries, Techniques, etc.) | **Spell Slots** |
| **Normal Attack** | Basic melee/ranged | **Free** (always available) |

This means tree abilities are your "always available" toolkit, while spellbook spells are limited-use power moves.

### Respec

**Free respec, anytime.** Kids can reset their entire tree and redistribute all points.

- No gold cost, no penalty
- Can respec between encounters, sessions, or during a rest
- Encourages experimentation

### Available Skill Trees

| Profession | Branches | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Knight (Warrior)** | Protection (tank), Arms (damage), Core (shared) | ✅ Complete — 52 skills |
| **Ranger** | Precision (sniper), Survival (traps + pets), Core (shared) | ✅ Complete — shares with Rogue |
| **Rogue** | Shadow (assassin), Precision (shared), Survival (shared), Core (shared) | ✅ Complete — 75 skills total |
| **Wizard** | *TBD — future expansion* | 🔜 Planned |
| **Healer** | *TBD — future expansion* | 🔜 Planned |
| **Inventor** | *TBD — future expansion* | 🔜 Planned |

> Full skill tree details (all 127 skills) are in [skill-trees.md](skill-trees.md).
