## The Story

> The village of **Brickton** has been peaceful for years, protected by the **Golden Crown** — a magic artifact that keeps the village gates sealed against monsters. But last night, a band of **goblins** crept in through the sewers and stole the Crown!
>
> Without it, the village gates are weakening. Monsters are already gathering in the forest. The **Mayor** is desperate and has called upon the only heroes brave (or bored) enough to help: **your party**.
>
> Track the goblins through the **Dark Forest**, enter the **Old Mine** where they've made their hideout, and defeat the **Goblin King** to reclaim the Stolen Crown!

---

## Scene 1: Brickton Village (5 minutes)

*Roleplay. No combat.*

### Read Aloud

> You're standing in the center of Brickton Village. It's a small, cozy town — little brick houses with colorful roofs, a bubbling fountain in the square, and a shop with a sign that says "CLOSED (Too Scared)."
>
> The Mayor — a short, round man with a ridiculously tall hat — waddles up to you, waving his arms.
>
> **"HEROES! Thank goodness you're here! The goblins stole our Golden Crown last night! Without it, the magic gate is failing! Can you hear that?"**
>
> *[Make a low growling noise]*
>
> **"That's the MONSTERS gathering in the forest! Please — follow the goblin tracks into the Dark Forest. They went toward the Old Mine. Get our Crown back!"**

### What Happens

- The Mayor gives each hero a **Health Potion** (restores 10 HP). This is their safety net.
- If they ask about the goblins: *"Nasty little green things! About yea high. Their leader calls himself the 'Goblin King' — ha! He's just a big goblin with a stolen crown on his head."*
- If they ask about the mine: *"Three caves deep. The goblins are in the back. Watch your step — there might be critters in the forest too."*
- Let them ask 1-2 questions, then nudge them toward the forest path.

### GM Tip

Keep this quick. Kids want to fight stuff. 2-3 minutes of talking max, then move to the forest.

---

## Scene 2: The Dark Forest (10 minutes)

*Easy combat encounter. Heroic Start is active (roll with advantage).*

### Read Aloud

> You follow a dirt path into the Dark Forest. The trees are tall and creepy, their branches blocking out most of the sunlight. You can see little goblin footprints in the mud.
>
> Suddenly — **SKREEEE!** — three **Giant Rats** burst out of the bushes! They're the size of small dogs, with glowing red eyes and very angry teeth.

### Encounter: Giant Rats

**Difficulty:** Easy (warmup fight)
**Heroic Start:** YES — both heroes roll attacks with advantage (2d20, keep higher) for this entire fight.

| Monster | HP | Dmg | MOV | DEF (TGH+8) | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|-------|
| Giant Rat (Minion) #1 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 9 | Dies in one hit |
| Giant Rat (Minion) #2 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 9 | Dies in one hit |
| Giant Rat (Minion) #3 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 9 | Dies in one hit |

**Rat attack roll:** d20 + SPD bonus (-1 no wait, SPD 4 so bonus = 4-3 = +1) vs hero TGH + 8.

### Grid Setup (10x10)

```
10 . . . . . . . . . .
 9 . . . . . . . . . .
 8 . . . R . . . R . .    R = Giant Rat
 7 . . . . . R . . . .

 2 . . . H . . H . . .    H = Hero
 1 . . . . . . . . . .
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

### How This Fight Should Go

- Heroes have **advantage** (Heroic Start). They should crush this.
- Rats have DEF 9 (TGH 1 + 8). With advantage, heroes will hit almost every time.
- Each rat is a **Minion** (1 HP) — any hit kills it, regardless of damage.
- Rats deal only 1 damage if they hit. They're pests, not threats.
- Let each hero get at least 1 kill. Describe it dramatically!

### After the Fight

> The last rat squeals and runs off into the bushes. You're safe! Among the rat nesting area, you spot something shiny...

**Loot:** Roll d20 per hero on the Loot Table (Lvl 1-4):
| Roll | Drop |
|------|------|
| 1-8 | 1 gold |
| 9-14 | 1 Common Seal |
| 15-18 | 2 Common Seals |
| 19 | 1 Uncommon Seal |
| 20 | 1 Uncommon Seal + bonus gold |

**XP:** 2 XP per rat minion = **6 XP total per hero**

> **Heroic Start ends!** The heroes just won their first combat. Advantage no longer applies. But they've got confidence now — onward!

---

## Scene 3: The Mine Entrance (10 minutes)

*Medium combat + puzzle moment.*

### Read Aloud

> You reach the entrance to the Old Mine. It's a dark hole in the side of a rocky hill, with goblin graffiti scratched into the stone — crude drawings of a crown and a big goblin sitting on a throne.
>
> As you step inside, torchlight flickers ahead. You hear goblin voices arguing:
>
> *"The King says guard the door!"*
> *"YOU guard the door! I wanna play with the shiny crown!"*
> *"BOTH of us guard the door, dummy!"*
>
> Two **Goblin Scouts** and one more little runt stand in your way.

### Encounter: Goblin Guards

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Heroic Start:** NO — normal rules now.

| Monster | HP | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | Dmg | MOV | DEF (TGH+8) | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------|-------|
| Goblin Scout #1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | Standard |
| Goblin Scout #2 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | Standard |
| Goblin Scout (Minion) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | Dies in 1 hit |

**Goblin attack:** d20 + STR bonus (-1) vs hero TGH + 8. With STR 2, bonus = -1, so they roll d20 - 1. Against a TGH 3 hero (DEF 11), they need to roll 12+. They'll miss a lot.

### Grid Setup (10x10)

```
10 . . . . . . . . . .    (tunnel continues north)
 9 . . . [WALL] . . .
 8 . . G . . G . . . .    G = Goblin Scout
 7 . . . . g . . . . .    g = Goblin Minion
 6 . . . . . . . . . .
 5 [ROCK] . . . . [ROCK]   Rocks = half cover
 4 . . . . . . . . . .
 3 . . . . . . . . . .
 2 . . . H . . H . . .    H = Hero
 1 . . . . . . . . . .    (entrance behind)
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

**Terrain Notes:**
- ROCK at (1,5) and (10,5): Half cover (+2 DEF for anyone behind it)
- WALL at (4-6,9): Blocks movement, heroes must go around to reach row 10

### How This Fight Should Go

- The minion goblin should die fast — let a hero one-shot it for momentum.
- The two standard Goblins have 5 HP each. With STR 3 heroes (or STR 5 with +2 points), heroes deal 3-5 damage per hit. Should take 1-2 hits each.
- Goblins deal 2 damage when they hit. Manageable against 14 HP heroes.
- Remind heroes they can use their **Starter Ability** (once per battle)!
- Remind heroes they have **Hero Surge** (reroll 1 die, once per battle) if they miss badly.

### Puzzle: The Locked Door

After the goblins are defeated:

> Past the guards, you find a heavy wooden door with a strange lock — three symbols carved into it: a **sun**, a **moon**, and a **star**. Above the door, scratched in goblin writing (translated): *"Brightest first, darkest last."*

**Solution:** Sun, Star, Moon (brightest to darkest). **SMT check DC 8 (Easy)** to figure it out. If both heroes fail, one goblin scout (if alive and captured) blurts out the answer in frustration.

**Reward:** 5 XP for solving the puzzle.

### After the Fight

**Loot:** Roll d20 per hero on the Loot Table (Lvl 1-4).

**XP:**
- 2 standard Goblin Scouts: 3 XP each = 6 XP
- 1 Goblin Minion: 2 XP
- Puzzle: 5 XP
- **Total: 13 XP per hero**

## Scene 4: The Goblin King's Throne Room (15 minutes)

*Boss fight! The big finale.*

### Read Aloud

> The door creaks open and you step into a wide cavern lit by dozens of stolen lanterns. At the far end sits a crude throne made of stacked rocks and old boxes.
>
> And there he is — the **Goblin King**. He's bigger than the other goblins, wearing a patchwork cape and... the **Golden Crown** sits crookedly on his ugly green head.
>
> He spots you and stands up, pointing a rusty sword at you.
>
> **"YOU! You want MY crown? MINE! I am the KING now! GUARDS — GET THEM!"**
>
> Two more goblin scouts rush from the shadows on either side!

### Encounter: The Goblin King

**Difficulty:** Boss fight

| Monster | HP | STR | SPD | TGH | SMT | Dmg | MOV | DEF (TGH+8) | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------------|-------|
| **Goblin King** (Boss) | **16** | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | **4** | 3 | **12** | Boss. See specials below. |
| Goblin Scout (Minion) #1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | Dies in 1 hit |
| Goblin Scout (Minion) #2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | Dies in 1 hit |

### Goblin King Special Abilities

1. **Crown Bash** (Action): Melee attack, d20 + 1 (STR bonus) vs hero DEF. On hit: **4 damage**.
2. **Royal Tantrum** (Below 8 HP, one-time): The Goblin King screams and **summons 2 more Goblin Scout Minions** (1 HP each) from side tunnels. They act on the King's next turn.
3. **"I'm the King!"** (Passive): The Goblin King cannot be frightened or intimidated. He's too dumb.

### Grid Setup (10x10)

```
10 . . . . [T] . . . . .    T = Throne (the King starts here)
 9 . . . . K . . . . .    K = Goblin King
 8 . . g . . . . g . .    g = Goblin Scout Minion
 7 . . . . . . . . . .
 6 . . . [PILLAR] . . .    PILLAR = full cover (blocks attacks)
 5 . . . . . . . . . .
 4 [PILLAR] . . . . [PILLAR]
 3 . . . . . . . . . .
 2 . . . H . . H . . .    H = Hero
 1 . . . . . . . . . .    (door behind)
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

**Terrain:**
- THRONE at (5,10): Just decoration, not blocking
- PILLAR at (4,6), (1,4), (10,4): Full cover (can hide behind, blocks line of sight)
- The Goblin King starts near his throne. He advances toward heroes.

### How This Fight Should Go

**Phase 1 (16-8 HP):**
- The Goblin King advances while his minion guards rush forward.
- Heroes should kill the minions quickly (1 HP each) — satisfying one-shots.
- The King has DEF 12. Heroes need to roll d20 + STR bonus >= 12. With STR 3 (bonus +0), they need 12+. With STR 5 (bonus +2), they need 10+. Fair odds.
- The King hits for 4 damage. Against 14 HP heroes, that's significant but not deadly. He'll take 3-4 hits to knock a hero out.

**Phase 2 (Below 8 HP — Royal Tantrum):**
- The King screams and 2 more minion goblins appear from side tunnels.
- Place them at (1,7) and (10,7) — flanking the heroes.
- This creates a moment of drama: *"Oh no, more goblins!"*
- But they're minions (1 HP each) — heroes can clean them up fast.

**Phase 3 (Finishing the King):**
- With 8 HP or less, the King fights desperately. Play up his frustration.
- *"NO! That's MY crown! MINE MINE MINE!"*
- When defeated, the Crown falls off his head and rolls to the nearest hero.

### GM Tips for the Boss Fight

- **Don't drop heroes to 0 HP** unless they're really unlucky. If a hero is low, have the King attack the other one next.
- **Remind them about potions!** They each have a Health Potion from the Mayor.
- **Remind them about Hero Surge** if they miss a critical attack.
- **Remind them about Starter Abilities** if they haven't used them yet.
- If a hero DOES go to 0 HP, the other hero can revive them with an action (1 HP). Drama!
- Make the killing blow **epic**. Describe it like a movie scene.

### After the Fight

> The Goblin King falls with a dramatic *THUD*, and the Golden Crown rolls across the stone floor. It glows faintly — you can feel its magic humming.
>
> As you pick it up, you notice something strange carved into the inside of the Crown: a symbol you don't recognize — a **dark tower** surrounded by swirling shadows.
>
> What does it mean? A mystery for another day...

---

## Scene 5: Victory! (5 minutes)

### Read Aloud

> You emerge from the mine, Crown in hand, into the sunlight. The walk back to Brickton feels lighter — the forest is quieter now that the goblins have scattered.
>
> The Mayor meets you at the gate, tears streaming down his face.
>
> **"You did it! YOU DID IT! The Crown! The village is saved!"**
>
> He places the Crown on a pedestal at the village gate. It glows bright gold, and you can feel the magical barrier strengthening around the village.
>
> **"Heroes, you have earned the eternal gratitude of Brickton! And also... this bag of gold. And these."**
>
> He hands each of you a pouch of coins and some shimmering seals.

## GM Cheat Sheet

### At-a-Glance Monster Stats

| Monster | HP | ATK Roll | DMG | DEF | Speed |
|---------|-----|----------|-----|-----|-------|
| Giant Rat (Minion) | 1 | d20+1 vs DEF | 1 | 9 | 5 |
| Goblin Scout | 5 | d20-1 vs DEF | 2 | 10 | 5 |
| Goblin Scout (Minion) | 1 | d20-1 vs DEF | 2 | 10 | 5 |
| **Goblin King** | **16** | **d20+1 vs DEF** | **4** | **12** | 3 |

### Hero Quick Math (Level 1, TGH 3)

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| HP | 14 |
| DEF (Melee) | TGH + 8 = 11 |
| DEF (Ranged) | SPD + 8 = 11 |
| Basic Melee ATK | d20 + STR bonus vs enemy DEF |
| Movement | 6 spaces per turn |

### Key Rules to Remember

1. **Heroic Start** — Advantage (2d20 keep higher) on attacks until first combat win (Scene 2 only)
2. **Minions** — 1 HP, any hit kills them
3. **Hero Surge** — Each hero can reroll 1 die per battle (flip their token face-down when used)
4. **Starter Ability** — Each hero has a once-per-battle ability from their profession
5. **Health Potions** — Each hero starts with 1 (from the Mayor). Restores 10 HP. Using it = 1 action.
6. **Knocked Out** — At 0 HP, hero is unconscious. Ally can revive with 1 action (hero wakes at 1 HP).

### Timing Guide

| Scene | Target Time | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Scene 1: Village | 3-5 min | Keep it snappy |
| Scene 2: Forest (Easy) | 5-8 min | Quick warmup |
| Scene 3: Mine (Medium) | 8-12 min | Real fight + puzzle |
| Scene 4: Boss | 10-15 min | Take your time here |
| Scene 5: Rewards | 3-5 min | Celebrate! |
| **TOTAL** | **30-45 min** | |

### If Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hero drops to 0 HP early | Goblin King switches to attack the other hero. Let downed hero's brother revive. |
| Both heroes are low HP | Have remaining goblins "trip over each other" and miss a turn. |
| Fight is too easy | Goblin King uses Crown Bash for a dramatic hit. Add 1 extra minion. |
| Fight is too hard | Goblin King brags for a turn instead of attacking. "Look at my beautiful crown!" |
| Kids are bored in Scene 1 | Skip straight to "you hear noises in the forest!" |
| Kids want to befriend a goblin | Let them! 5 bonus XP. Goblin becomes a cowardly guide. |
