# 🌳 LEGO QUEST — Skill Trees

*Complete skill tree reference for all professions. v1.1 — Starter abilities at Level 1.*

---

## Overview

Every profession has a **skill tree** — a branching web of abilities and bonuses unlocked with skill points. Think Diablo talent trees or World of Warcraft specializations.

### How It Works

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Starter Ability** | Every hero gets their profession's first node **auto-unlocked at Level 1** for free |
| **Skill Points** | Earn 1 per level starting at Level 2 (2 at Level 20). Total: 20 points by Level 20 |
| **Spending** | Points go into skills within your profession's branches |
| **Tiers** | Branches have tiers. Spend enough points in a branch to unlock higher tiers |
| **Ranks** | Some skills have multiple ranks (invest more points for stronger effects) |
| **Respec** | **Free, anytime.** Reset your entire tree between encounters, sessions, or during rest |

### Skill Types

| Type | Icon | How It Works |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Active** | ⚔️ | Goes in your Action Bar. Use as an action in combat. Free (cooldown-based). |
| **Passive** | 🛡️ | Always on. No action needed. Permanent bonuses. |

### The Action Bar (5 Slots)

Heroes have **5 action bar slots** for active abilities.

- Only **active skills** (⚔️) and **spellbook spells** go in slots
- **Passive skills** are always on — no slot needed
- Swap abilities freely outside of combat
- Normal melee/ranged attacks are always available (no slot needed)

### Skill Points by Level

| Level | Skill Points Earned | Total Available |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Starter ability (free) | 0 spendable |
| 2 | +1 | 1 |
| 3 | +1 | 2 |
| 4 | +1 | 3 |
| 5 | +1 | 4 |
| 10 | +1 | 9 |
| 15 | +1 | 14 |
| 20 | +2 | 20 |

### Skill Trees + Spellbook

The skill tree **extends** the spellbook system — it doesn't replace it.

| System | What It Provides | Cost to Use |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Skill Tree** | Talent tree skills + passives | **Free** (with cooldowns on strong abilities) |
| **Spellbook** | Profession spells (Battle Cries, Techniques, etc.) | **Spell Slots** |
| **Normal Attack** | Basic melee/ranged | **Free** (always available) |

Tree abilities are your "always available" toolkit. Spellbook spells are limited-use power moves.

# ⚔️ WARRIOR (KNIGHT) CLASS

---

### 🛡️ PROTECTION BRANCH — "The Unbreakable Wall"

*"They shall not pass." You are the shield. You stand between your friends and danger, absorb punishment that would flatten anyone else, and force enemies to deal with YOU instead of the squishy wizard behind you.*

---

| # | Skill | Type | Ranks | Effect |
|---|-------|------|-------|--------|
| P10 | **Shield Throw** | ⚔️ Active | 2 | Hurl your shield at a target up to 6 studs away: STR damage and it bounces to 1 / 2 additional enemies for half damage. Shield returns to you. *Lego: Actually slide the shield piece across the table!* |
| P11 | **Fortress** | ⚔️ Active | 1 | For 3 turns: you take HALF damage from everything, but you can't move. Plant your feet. |
| P12 | **Rallying Presence** | 🛡️ Passive | 2 | When you use Taunt or any Protection ability, all allies within 4 studs heal 2 / 4 HP. |

#### Tier 4 — Mastery (12+ points in Protection)

| # | Skill | Type | Ranks | Effect |
|---|-------|------|-------|--------|
| P14 | **Unbreakable** | ⚔️ Active | 1 | For 2 turns, you CANNOT be reduced below 1 HP. Period. |
| P15 | **Divine Shield** | ⚔️ Active | 1 | Choose one ally. For 3 turns, all damage they would take hits you instead. Combined with Fortress, you take a quarter damage. |
| P16 | **Last Stand** | ⚔️ Active | 1 | When you drop to 0 HP, instead stand at 1 HP, get +5 STR, and take a free attack. Once per long rest. The most dramatic moment possible. |
