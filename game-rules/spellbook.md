# ðŸ“– LEGO QUEST â€” Spellbook

Every profession gets **spells** (or spell-like abilities). Knights call them **Battle Cries**, Rangers call them **Techniques**, Wizards call them **Spells**, Healers call them **Prayers**, Rogues call them **Tricks**, and Inventors call them **Blueprints**. Mechanically they all use the same spell slot system.

> **How Spells and Skill Trees Work Together**
>
> Heroes have two ability systems: **Spellbook spells** (this document) cost **spell slots** and are powerful limited-use abilities. **Skill tree abilities** (see `skill-trees.md`) are **free to use** with cooldowns and are your always-available toolkit. Both types share the same **5-slot Action Bar** — you mix and match spellbook spells and tree skills in whatever combination you want. Normal attacks are always free and don't take a slot.

> **Important:** Spell slots are used ONLY for spellbook spells listed in this document. Skill tree active abilities (from `skill-trees.md`) are free to use and do NOT consume spell slots. This means even when you're out of spell slots, you still have interesting options from your skill tree.
