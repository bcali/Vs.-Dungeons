# 📖 LEGO QUEST — Spellbook

Every profession gets **abilities** (spells, techniques, tricks, etc.). Knights call them **Battle Cries**, Rangers call them **Techniques**, Wizards call them **Spells**, Healers call them **Prayers**, Rogues call them **Tricks**, and Inventors call them **Blueprints**. Each profession uses its own resource to fuel abilities.
